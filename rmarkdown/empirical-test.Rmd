# Data

To test the capacity of the proposed model in explaining experimental
findings under the "Money Earlier or Later" (MEL) paradigm, I select two
open datasets. The first dataset is from @ericson_money_2015, containing
23,131 observations from 939 participants; the second is from
@chavez_hierarchical_2017, containing 34,515 choices from 1,284
participants. Hereafter, I term the first dataset as *Ericson* data, and
the second dataset as *Ch치vez* data. Each dataset has been used in more
than one previous study.[^1] Readers interested in the empirical method
and the results of this paper can easily compare them with those of
other papers. For both datasets, the corresponding experiments require
the participants to answer a series of choice questions. For each
question, participants need to make a choice between an small sooner
reward (denoted by SS) and a large later reward (denoted by LL). I
denote the reward magnitude and delay by $x_s$ and $t_s$ for option SS,
and by $x_l$ and $t_l$ for option LL, where $x_l>x_s>0$, $t_l>t_s$.

[^1]: For example, *Ericson* data is used by @wulff_modeling_2018 for
    discussing the proper ways to compare different choice models.
    *Ch치vez* data is used by @gershman_rationally_2020 for testing their
    proposed attention-based choice model.

Notably, there are significant differences in experimental procedure
underlying the datasets. In *Ericson* data, the participants are
recruited via Mechanical Turk. Rewards are framed in US dollars, ranging
from USD 0.03 to USD 10100. For 25.4% of the observations, option SS has
a reward less than USD 3. Delays are framed in weeks. Delays for SS
range from 0 to 2 weeks, and the maximum delay for LL is 5 weeks. In
*Ch치vez* data, the participants are Mexican high school and first-year
university students, and attending the experiment is a class
requirement. Rewards are framed in Mexican pesos, ranging from MXD 11
(approx. USD 0.6) to MXD 85 (approx. USD 4.7). Delays are framed in
days. All sooner rewards are delivered "today" ($t_s=0$), and the
maximum delay for LL is 186 days. Given that the two datasets employ
different frames and ranges for rewards and delays, a same model fitted
on these datasets may have different parameters and goodness of fit.

I mainly focus on out-of-sample model performance. For each dataset, I
randomly draw the responses from 20% of the participants as the test
sample, and set the rest as the train sample. To mitigate the
overfitting issue, I implement a 10-fold cross-validation procedure on
the train sample.

# Empirical Strategy

I test three types of intertemporal choice model: discounted utility
model, trade-off model, and heuristic model.

The discounted utility model assumes that the decision maker tends to
choose the option with greater discounted utility. Let the discounted
utility for option $j$ ($j\in\{l,s\}$) be $v_j=d(t_j)u(x_j)$, where
$d(.)$ is the discounting function and $u(.)$ is the instantanoues
utility function. Suppose the decision maker's perceived discounted
utility for each option, denoted by is $\tilde{v_l}$ and $\tilde{v_s}$,
is noisy. I set $\tilde{v_l}=v_l+\eta_l$, $\tilde{v_s}=v_s+\eta_s$. When
$\eta_l$ and $\eta_s$ are independent noises and both follow
$Gumble(0,\rho)$, where the scale parameter $\rho\in(0,\infty)$, the
probability that the decision maker chooses LL is

$$
P\{\tilde{v_s}\leq\tilde{v_l}\}=\frac{1}{1+\exp\{-\frac{1}{\rho}(v_l-v_s)\}}
$$

The trade-off model [@scholten_psychology_2010; @scholten_weighing_2014]
assumes that when thinking of whether to choose LL, the decision maker
tends to make a comparison between attributes (reward and time), rather
than between options (LL and SS). If the benefit of receiving a larger
reward exceeds the cost of waiting longer, she will choose LL;
otherwise, she will choose SS. Let $B$ denote the benefit of receiving a
larger reward, $Q$ denote the cost of waiting longer. The value of $B$
can be simply represented by $u(x_l)-u(x_s)$. Following
@scholten_weighing_2014, I represent $Q$ by

$$
Q =\frac{\kappa}{\zeta_1}\ln\left(1+\zeta_1\left(\frac{w(t_l)-w(t_s)}{\zeta_2}\right)^{\zeta_2}\right)
$$

where $w(t)=\ln(1+\omega t)/\omega$. The parameter $\omega$ measures the
magnitude in which time is distorted in the decision maker's mind;
$\kappa$ measures the relative importance of reducing waiting time
compared with increasing reward magnitude; $\zeta_1$, $\zeta_2$ jointly
determine the curvature of changes in $Q$ relative to $t_l-t_s$.[^2] I
assume the decision maker's perception of $B$ and $Q$, denoted by
$\tilde{B}$ and $\tilde{Q}$, is noisy. $\tilde{B}=B+\eta_B$,
$\tilde{Q}=Q+\eta_Q$, where $\eta_B$ and $\eta_Q$ are noise terms.
Again, assume $\eta_B$ and $\eta_Q$ are independent and follow
$Gumble(0,\rho)$, then the probability that the decision maker chooses
LL is

[^2]: @scholten_weighing_2014 use these two parameters
    $\{\zeta_1,\zeta_2\}$ to ensure that $Q$ follow a S-shape curve in
    relation to $t_l-t_s$, and that the decision-maker's behavioral
    pattern can shift between sub-additivity and super-additivity.

$$
P\{\tilde{Q}\leq\tilde{B}\}=\frac{1}{1+\exp\{-\frac{1}{\rho}(B-Q)\}}
$$

For the heuristic model, I employ a decision tree algorithm called
XGBoost [@chen_xgboost_2016]. The intuition underlying XGBoost is that,
the decision-maker uses a chain of if-then rules to make a choice, and
repeats this process for several times, adding up the results of each
iteration to make the final decision. This algorithm has been widely
used in solving classfication problems (including predicting human risky
choices, see \citealt{plonsky_predicting_2019}). To better fit the data,
I tune the hyper-parameters of this algorithm via grid search. For
*Ericson* data, the features I use are $x_s$, $x_l$, $t_s$, $t_l$, the
absolute and relative differences between $x_s$ and $x_l$, the absolute
and relative differences between $t_l$ and $t_s$, the interest rate of
LL when SS is invested as principal. For *Ch치vez* data, given that
$t_s=0$, I omit $t_s$ and the differences between $t_s$ and $t_l$ from
the features.[^3]

[^3]: The features are extracted following the methods in
    @read_drift_2013 and @ericson_money_2015.

The attention-adjusted discounting factor is dependent on the decision
maker's initial attention allocation. I test the model under the
assumptions that initial attention allocation is exponential and uniform
(I term the former as "*attention*", the latter as "*attention_uni*").
Along with the attention-adjusted discounting, I employ 8 other methods
to draw discounting factors, which are:

1.  **exponential**, denoted by "*expo*"

$$
d(t) =\delta^t
$$

where the parameter is $\delta$ and $\delta\in(0,1]$.

2.  **double exponential**, denoted by "*expo2*"
    [@van_den_bos_towards_2013]

$$
d(t) = \omega\delta_1^t+(1-\omega)\delta_2^t
$$

where the parameters are $\{\delta_1, \delta_2, \omega\}$, and
$\delta_1,\delta_2\in(0,1]$.

3.  **hyperbolic**, denoted by "*hb*"

$$
d(t) = \frac{1}{1+kt}
$$

where the parameter is $k$.

4.  **dual-parameter hyperbolic**, denoted by "*hb2*"
    [@loewenstein_anomalies_1992]

$$
d(t) = \frac{1}{(1+kt)^a}
$$

where the parameters are $\{k,a\}$.

5.  **magnitude-dependent hyperbolic**, denoted by "*hbmd*"
    [@gershman_rationally_2020]

$$
d(t) = \frac{1}{1+kt}, \quad k=\frac{1}{b u(x_t)}
$$

where the parameter is $b$.

6.  **quasi-hyperbolic**, denoted by "*quasihb*"[@laibson_golden_1997]

$$
d(t)= \textbf{1}\{t=0\}+ \beta\delta^t\cdot\textbf{1}\{t>0\}
$$

where the parameters are $\{\beta, \delta\}$, and
$\beta,\delta\in(0,1]$.

7.  **quasi-hyperbolic plus fixed delay cost**, denoted by
    "*quasihb_fc*" [@benhabib_present-bias_2010]

$$
d(t)= \textbf{1}\{t=0\}+ (\beta\delta^t-\frac{c}{u(x_t)})\cdot\textbf{1}\{t>0\}
$$ where the parameters are $\{\beta, \delta, c\}$, and
$\beta,\delta\in(0,1]$.

8.  **homogeneous costly empathy**, denoted by "*hce*"
    [@noor_optimal_2022]

$$
d_t = \kappa_t u(x_t)^{\frac{1}{m}}
$$

where $\kappa_t$ is decreasing in $t$. I set $\kappa_t=\delta^t$, where
the parameters are $\{m, \delta\}$ and $\delta\in(0,1]$.

Besides, I employ 2 types of utility functions to obtain $u(.)$:
exponential or CARA utility, where $u(x)=1-e^{-\gamma x}$; power
utility, where $u(x) = x^{\gamma}$. In each utility function, $\gamma$
is the parameter, $\gamma\in (0,\infty)$. For parameters in discounting
function, except for those explicitly marked as having a domain between
0 and 1, the domain of all other parameters is $(0,\infty)$. In model
fitting, if a parameter has a lower bound of 0, I set its lower bound to
0.001; if a parameter has a upper bound of infinity, I set its upper
bound to 100.

I use the maximum likelihood method to estimate the parameters, and
apply L-BFGS-B method for optimization. As the solutions of L-BFGS-B are
sensitive to initial points and often converge to local optima, I use
the basin-hopping algorithm to achieve global optimization. [^4]
Finally, I compare the goodness of fit and out-of-sample performance of
20 discounted utility models, 2 trade-off models, and 1 heuristic model
on the two datasets.

[^4]: The basin-hopping algorithm runs a local optimizer for several
    times. After each iteration, the solution randomly drifts to a new
    point. This new point is taken as the initial point for the next
    iteration. The algorithm compares the solution of the next iteration
    with the original solution, and is more likely to accept the better
    solution between them (note there is still some probability of
    accepting an inferior solution). The magnitude of drifting is
    dependent on a stepwise parameter, which I set as 0.5; the
    probability of accepting the inferior solution is dependent on a
    temper parameter, which I set as 1.0. I also set the maximum number
    of iterations as 500.

# Result

## Results for *Ericson* data

Table \ref{tab:ericson_kf_result} shows the goodness of fit for each
model in cross-validation. The heuristic model has the highest accuracy
rate, the lowest log loss, and the lowest MAE. The trade-off (*trade*)
model with power utility performs the lowest MSE. The
magnitude-dependent hyperbolic (*hbmd*) model with power utility ranks
the second or third in all evaluation metrics. On the test sample, these
three models also perform the best in MSE, MAE, log loss and accuracy
rate (see Table \ref{tab:ericson_test_result}). To test the correlation
between these models, I randomly draw 1,000 choice questions from
*Ericson* data, and set the choices predicted by the heuristic model as
labels, letting the other models to predict them. The accuracy rate for
*trade* with power utility is the highest, which is 95.7%, and the
second is *hbmd* with power utility (95.0%).

Remarkably, the heuristic model has the most parameters that need to be
fitted. Apart from the heuristic model, the model that has the largest
number of parameters is *trade*, which has 6 parameters to be fitted.
The *hbmd* model has only 3 parameters to be fitted.

Now we focus on attention-adjusted models. First, it is notable that
*hbmd* can be viewed as a special case of the attention-adjusted models.
[^5] Magnitude-dependent hyperbolic discounting plus power utility is
identical to attention-adjusted discounting under uniform initial
attention allocation, plus log utility. We can conclude that log utility
function fits the data better than power and CARA functions under
attention-adjusted model.

[^5]: Note that under the assumption that the initial attention is
    uniformly allocated, the discounting factor in attention-adjusted
    model is $1/(1+kt)$, where $k=e^{-u(x_t)/\lambda}$. Setting
    $u(x)/\lambda=\ln\beta+\gamma\ln x$, we can get the
    magnitude-dependent hyperbolic model with power utility.

Second, the last column in Table \ref{tab:ericson_test_result}, which
reports the ratio of LL in predicted choices, gives us a hint on why
attention-adjusted discounting plus CARA or power utility underperforms
some other models. The attention-adjusted models with CARA (or power)
utility seem underestimating the participants' tendency to choose LL in
*Ericson* data. For example, *attention_uni* with power utility predicts
only 15.7% of the choices are LL, whereas the heuristic model predicts
29% of the choices are LL.

Third, the underperformance of attention-adjusted models can be partly
attributed to the fact that *Ericson* data contains a significant number
of extreme rewards: 8.7% of the rewards for SS are less than USD 1; in
comparison, 7.6% are larger than USD 10000.

In Chavez data, the smallest $x_s$ is 11, the smallest $x_l$ is 25.

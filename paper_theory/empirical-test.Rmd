# The Model

## Attention Reallocation Process

Suppose a decision maker is to evaluate a sequence of rewards, which
depends on the state of world $s$. The time length of this sequence is
$T$. Let $t$ denote each time point, $t\in [0,T]$. The decision maker
draws a random sample of the time points within $[0,T]$, and aggregate
the utilities that could be obtained at each sampled time point, to
construct a value representation of $s$. Her objective is to find a
sampling strategy $f(t,s)$, which denotes the probability of selecting a
time point $t$ into the sample under a certain state $s$. I denote the
prior probability of $s$ occurring by $p(s)$ and the prior probability
of selecting $t$ into the sample by $p(t)$ . The decision maker wants to
maximize her total utility through $f$; thus, time points with larger
rewards should be sampled more frequently (that is, she wants to
selectively pay more attention on these time points). However,
processing reward information and shifting attention trigger a cognitive
cost. Let $u(.)$ denote the instantaneous utility function. Following
the rational inattention literature [@matejka_rational_2015;
@caplin_rationally_2022; @mackowiak_rational_2023], I frame the decision
maker's optimization problem as $$
\begin{split}
& \max_f\; \int u(t,s)f(t,s)dtds - \lambda I(t;s) \\
& s.t. \; \int f(t,s)dt = p(s),\, \forall s
\end{split}
$$

where $\lambda I(t;s)$ is the attention cost function, $\lambda$ is a
fixed parameter and $I(t;s)$ denotes Shannon mutual information. $$
I(t;s)=\int f(t,s) \log\left(\frac{f(t,s)}{p(t)p(s)}\right)dtds
$$ The solution needs to satisfy
$f(t|s) \propto p(t)e^{u(t,s)/\lambda}$, where $\int f(t|s)dt=1$.

Considering discrete time $t \in\{0,1,...,T\}$, we can replace $p(t)$
and $f(t|s)$ by the decision weight (or discounting factor) assigned to
time point $t$. Let $w^0_t$ denote the initial weight assigned to $t$
and $w_t$ denote the decision weight after optimization, i.e.
$w_t^0 \equiv p(t)$, $w_t \equiv f(t|s)$, then $\{w^0_t\}_{t=0}^T$ and
$\{w_t\}_{t=0}^T$ can represent the initial and adjusted attention
allocations. I assume the decision maker is initially time-consistent,
that is, $w_t^0 = \delta^t$, where $\delta$ is the exponential
discounting parameter, $\delta \in (0,1]$.

## SS or LL

In a "Money Earlier or Later" (MEL) task, the decision maker needs to
make a choice between different options. For each option, she is
informed the amount of reward she would receive in a specific time point
$t$, which I denote by $x_t$. The reward is pre-determined, thus the
state $s$ is fixed. The decision maker simply wants to choose the option
that has the maximum $\sum_{t} w_t u(x_t)$, where
$w_t \propto \delta^t e^{u(x_t)/\lambda}$ and $\sum_{t=0}^T w_t =1$.
Suppose the reward only arrives at time point $T$, that is, $x_t=0$ for
all $t<T$. The optimal weight for $T$ is $$
w_T = \frac{1}{1+G(T)\cdot e^{-v(x_T)/\lambda}}
$$ where $$
G(T) = \left\{\begin{split}
& T &, \delta=1\\
& \frac{1}{1-\delta}(\delta^{-T}-1) &,0<\delta<1
\end{split}\right.
$$

When $\delta=1$, I say the initial attention is uniformly allocated.

# Data

To test the capacity of attention-adjusted discounting factor in
explaining the findings of MEL experiments, I select two open datasets.
The first dataset is from @ericson_money_2015, containing 23,131
observations from 939 participants; the second is from
@chavez_hierarchical_2017, containing 34,515 choices from 1,284
participants. Hereafter, I term the first dataset as *Ericson* data, and
the second dataset as *Ch치vez* data. Each dataset has been used in more
than one previous study.[^1] Readers interested in the empirical method
and the results of this paper can easily compare them with those of
other papers. For both datasets, the corresponding experiments require
the participants to answer a series of choice questions. In each
question, participants need to make a choice between an small sooner
reward (denoted by SS) and a large later reward (denoted by LL). I
denote the reward magnitude and delay by $x_s$ and $t_s$ for option SS,
and by $x_l$ and $t_l$ for option LL, where $x_l>x_s>0$, $t_l>t_s$.

[^1]: For example, *Ericson* data is used by @wulff_modeling_2018 for
    discussing the proper ways to compare different choice models.
    *Ch치vez* data is used by @gershman_rationally_2020 for testing their
    proposed attention-based choice model.

Notably, there are significant differences in experimental procedure
underlying the datasets. In *Ericson* data, the participants are
recruited via Mechanical Turk. Rewards are framed in US dollars, ranging
from 0.03 USD to 10,100 USD. 33% of the observations have a $x_s$ no
larger than 5 USD, 30% of the $x_s$ are between 5 USD and 100 USD, 22%
of the $x_s$ are between 100 USD and 1,000 USD, while 15% are between
1,000 USD and 10,000 USD. Delays are framed in weeks. Delays for SS
range from 0 to 2 weeks, and the maximum delay for LL is 5 weeks. In
*Ch치vez* data, the participants are Mexican high school and first-year
university students, and attending the experiment is a class
requirement. Rewards are framed in Mexican pesos, ranging from 11 MXD
(approx. 0.6 USD) to 85 (approx. 4.7 MXD). Delays are framed in days.
All sooner rewards are delivered "today" ($t_s=0$), and the maximum
delay for LL is 186 days. Given that the two datasets employ different
frames and ranges for rewards and delays, a same model fitted on these
datasets may have different parameters and goodness of fit.

I mainly focus on out-of-sample model performance. For each dataset, I
randomly draw the responses from 20% of the participants as the test
sample, and set the rest as the train sample. To mitigate the
overfitting issue, I implement a 10-fold cross-validation procedure on
the train sample.

# Empirical Strategy

I test three types of intertemporal choice model: discounted utility
model, trade-off model, and heuristic model.

The discounted utility model assumes that the decision maker tends to
choose the option with greater discounted utility. Let the discounted
utility for option $j$ ($j\in\{l,s\}$) be $v_j=d(t_j)u(x_j)$, where
$d(.)$ is the discounting function. Suppose the decision maker's
perceived discounted utility for each option, denoted by is
$\tilde{v_l}$ and $\tilde{v_s}$, is noisy. I set
$\tilde{v_l}=v_l+\eta_l$, $\tilde{v_s}=v_s+\eta_s$. When $\eta_l$ and
$\eta_s$ are independent noises and both follow $Gumble(0,\rho)$, where
the scale parameter $\rho\in(0,\infty)$, the probability that the
decision maker chooses LL is

$$
P\{\tilde{v_s}\leq\tilde{v_l}\}=\frac{1}{1+\exp\{-\frac{1}{\rho}(v_l-v_s)\}}
$$

The trade-off model [@scholten_psychology_2010; @scholten_weighing_2014]
assumes that when thinking of whether to choose LL, the decision maker
tends to make a comparison between attributes (reward and time), rather
than between options (LL and SS). If the benefit of receiving a larger
reward exceeds the cost of waiting longer, she will choose LL;
otherwise, she will choose SS. Let $B$ denote the benefit of receiving a
larger reward, $Q$ denote the cost of waiting longer. The value of $B$
can be simply represented by $u(x_l)-u(x_s)$. Following
@scholten_weighing_2014, I represent $Q$ by

$$
Q =\frac{\kappa}{\zeta_1}\ln\left(1+\zeta_1\left(\frac{w(t_l)-w(t_s)}{\zeta_2}\right)^{\zeta_2}\right)
$$

where $w(t)=\ln(1+\omega t)/\omega$. The parameter $\omega$ measures the
magnitude in which time is distorted in the decision maker's mind;
$\kappa$ measures the relative importance of reducing waiting time
compared with increasing reward magnitude; $\zeta_1$, $\zeta_2$ jointly
determine the curvature of changes in $Q$ relative to $t_l-t_s$.[^2] I
assume the decision maker's perception of $B$ and $Q$, denoted by
$\tilde{B}$ and $\tilde{Q}$, is noisy. $\tilde{B}=B+\eta_B$,
$\tilde{Q}=Q+\eta_Q$, where $\eta_B$ and $\eta_Q$ are noise terms.
Again, assume $\eta_B$ and $\eta_Q$ are independent and follow
$Gumble(0,\rho)$, then the probability that the decision maker chooses
LL is

[^2]: @scholten_weighing_2014 use these two parameters
    $\{\zeta_1,\zeta_2\}$ to ensure that $Q$ follow a S-shape curve in
    relation to $t_l-t_s$, and that the decision-maker's behavioral
    pattern can shift between sub-additivity and super-additivity.

$$
P\{\tilde{Q}\leq\tilde{B}\}=\frac{1}{1+\exp\{-\frac{1}{\rho}(B-Q)\}}
$$

For the heuristic model, I employ a decision tree algorithm called
XGBoost [@chen_xgboost_2016]. The intuition underlying XGBoost is that,
the decision-maker uses a chain of if-then rules to make a choice, and
repeats this process for several times, adding up the results of each
iteration to make the final decision. This algorithm has been widely
used in solving classfication problems (including predicting human risky
choices, see \citealt{plonsky_predicting_2019}). To better fit the data,
I tune the hyper-parameters of this algorithm via grid search. For
*Ericson* data, the features I use are $x_s$, $x_l$, $t_s$, $t_l$, the
absolute and relative differences between $x_s$ and $x_l$, the absolute
and relative differences between $t_l$ and $t_s$, the interest rate of
LL when SS is invested as principal. For *Ch치vez* data, given that
$t_s=0$, I omit $t_s$ and the differences between $t_s$ and $t_l$ from
the features.[^3]

[^3]: The features are extracted following the methods in
    @read_drift_2013 and @ericson_money_2015.

The attention-adjusted discounting factor is dependent on the decision
maker's initial attention allocation. I test the model under the
assumptions that initial attention allocation is exponential and uniform
(I term the former as "*attention*", the latter as "*attention_uni*").
Along with the attention-adjusted discounting, I employ 8 other methods
to draw discounting factors, which are:

1.  **exponential**, denoted by "*expo*"

$$
d(t) =\delta^t
$$

where the parameter is $\delta$ and $\delta\in(0,1]$.

2.  **double exponential**, denoted by "*expo2*"
    [@van_den_bos_towards_2013]

$$
d(t) = \omega\delta_1^t+(1-\omega)\delta_2^t
$$

where the parameters are $\{\delta_1, \delta_2, \omega\}$, and
$\delta_1,\delta_2\in(0,1]$.

3.  **hyperbolic**, denoted by "*hb*"

$$
d(t) = \frac{1}{1+kt}
$$

where the parameter is $k$.

4.  **dual-parameter hyperbolic**, denoted by "*hb2*"
    [@loewenstein_anomalies_1992]

$$
d(t) = \frac{1}{(1+kt)^a}
$$

where the parameters are $\{k,a\}$.

5.  **magnitude-dependent hyperbolic**, denoted by "*hbmd*"
    [@gershman_rationally_2020]

$$
d(t) = \frac{1}{1+kt}, \quad k=\frac{1}{b u(x_t)}
$$

where the parameter is $b$.

6.  **quasi-hyperbolic**, denoted by "*quasihb*"[@laibson_golden_1997]

$$
d(t)= \textbf{1}\{t=0\}+ \beta\delta^t\cdot\textbf{1}\{t>0\}
$$

where the parameters are $\{\beta, \delta\}$, and
$\beta,\delta\in(0,1]$.

7.  **quasi-hyperbolic plus fixed delay cost**, denoted by
    "*quasihb_fc*" [@benhabib_present-bias_2010]

$$
d(t)= \textbf{1}\{t=0\}+ (\beta\delta^t-\frac{c}{u(x_t)})\cdot\textbf{1}\{t>0\}
$$ where the parameters are $\{\beta, \delta, c\}$, and
$\beta,\delta\in(0,1]$.

8.  **homogeneous costly empathy**, denoted by "*hce*"
    [@noor_optimal_2022]

$$
d_t = \kappa_t u(x_t)^{\frac{1}{m}}
$$

where $\kappa_t$ is decreasing in $t$. I set $\kappa_t=\delta^t$, where
the parameters are $\{m, \delta\}$ and $\delta\in(0,1]$.

Besides, I employ 2 types of utility functions to obtain $u(.)$:
exponential or CARA utility, where $u(x)=1-e^{-\gamma x}$; power
utility, where $u(x) = x^{\gamma}$. In each utility function, $\gamma$
is the parameter, $\gamma\in (0,\infty)$. For parameters in discounting
function, except for those explicitly marked as having a domain between
0 and 1, the domain of all other parameters is $(0,\infty)$. In model
fitting, if a parameter has a lower bound of 0, I set its lower bound to
0.001; if a parameter has a upper bound of infinity, I set its upper
bound to 100.

I use the maximum likelihood method to estimate the parameters, and
apply L-BFGS-B method for optimization. As the solutions of L-BFGS-B are
sensitive to initial points and often converge to local optima, I use
the basin-hopping algorithm to achieve global optimization. [^4]
Finally, I compare the goodness of fit and out-of-sample performance of
20 discounted utility models, 2 trade-off models, and 1 heuristic model
on the two datasets.

[^4]: The basin-hopping algorithm runs a local optimizer for several
    times. After each iteration, the solution randomly drifts to a new
    point. This new point is taken as the initial point for the next
    iteration. The algorithm compares the solution of the next iteration
    with the original solution, and is more likely to accept the better
    solution between them (note there is still some probability of
    accepting an inferior solution). The magnitude of drifting is
    dependent on a stepwise parameter, which I set as 0.5; the
    probability of accepting the inferior solution is dependent on a
    temper parameter, which I set as 1.0. I also set the maximum number
    of iterations as 500.

# Result

## Results for *Ericson* data

Table \ref{tab:ericson_kf_result} shows the goodness of fit for each
model in cross-validation. The heuristic model has the highest accuracy
rate, the lowest log loss, and the lowest MAE. The trade-off (*trade*)
model with power utility performs the lowest MSE. The
magnitude-dependent hyperbolic (*hbmd*) model with power utility ranks
the second or third in all evaluation metrics. On the test sample, these
three models also perform the best in MSE, MAE, log loss and accuracy
rate (see Table \ref{tab:ericson_test_result}). To test the correlation
between these models, I randomly draw 1,000 choice questions from
*Ericson* data, and set the choices predicted by the heuristic model as
labels, letting the other models to predict them. The accuracy rate for
*trade* with power utility is the highest, which is 95.7%, and the
second is *hbmd* with power utility (95.0%).

```
Now we focus on attention-adjusted models. First, it is notable that
*hbmd* can be viewed as a special case of the attention-adjusted models.
[^5] Magnitude-dependent hyperbolic discounting plus power utility is
identical to attention-adjusted discounting under uniform initial
attention allocation plus log utility. We can conclude that log utility
function fits the data better than power and CARA functions under
attention-adjusted model settings.

[^5]: Note that under the assumption that the initial attention is
    uniformly allocated, the discounting factor in attention-adjusted
    model is $1/(1+kt)$, where $k=e^{-u(x_t)/\lambda}$. Setting
    $u(x)/\lambda=\ln\beta+\gamma\ln x$, we can get the
    magnitude-dependent hyperbolic model with power utility.

Second, the reason why attention-adjusted models with power or CARA
utility underpeform than some other models can be (at least partially)
attributed to the distribution of observations on *Ericson* data. Note
that the rewards for SS follow a power-law-like distribution in
*Ericson* data. The data contains a substantial proportion of very small
rewards, compared with the reward range: 33% of the $x_s$ are no larger
than 5 USD, whereas only 15% are between 1,000 USD and 10,000 USD. The
derivatives of exponential and power functions (with a positive power)
at a small number are much smaller than that of a log function. Thus,
for a small reward, neither CARA utility nor power utility of it can
significantly differ from the utility of its near neighbors, and this
makes it more difficult for a model to learn the decision makers'
choices on the given data.

Third, the last column in Table \ref{tab:ericson_test_result}, which
reports the ratio of LL in predicted choices, also gives us a hint on
why attention-adjusted models underperform. This kind of models seem
underestimating the participants' tendency to choose LL in *Ericson*
data. For example, *attention_uni* with power utility predicts only
15.7% of the choices are LL, whereas the heuristic model and *hbmd* with
power utility predict 29% and 23.7% of the choices are LL respectively.
To some extent, this can also be attributed to the fact that there are
many small rewards in the data. Considering *hbmd* and *attention_uni*
models, the discounting factor of each can be formatted as $1/(1+kt)$,
where $k=e^{-u(x)/\lambda}$ for *attention_uni* and
$k=(\beta u(x) )^{-1}$ for *hbmd*. When $x$ approaches to 0, under both
CARA and power utility settings, the $k$ in *attention_uni* approaches
to 1, while the $k$ in *hbmd* approaches to infinity. Thus, the utility
of a small reward under *hbmd* may be discounted more heavily than that
under *attention_uni*. In such a case, suppose a decision maker still
prefers a delayed reward to an immediate reward, the *hbmd* model should
conclude the decision maker is more patient in comparison to
*attention_uni*.

To check if sample distribution affects the performance of models, I
conduct two follow-up analyses on *Ericson* data. Table
\ref{tab:follow_test_result} shows the performance of the seven models
with the highest out-of-sample prediction accuracy for each follow-up
analysis. In the first analysis, I set 0.01 USD as reward unit, and
replace $x_s$ and $x_l$ by their logarithms (keeping other features
equal)[^6], then re-train and test the models. The results for the first
analysis are presented in Panel A of Table \ref{tab:follow_test_result}.
The highest accuracy is for the heuristic model, and its accuracy rate
rises from 70.2% in \ref{tab:ericson_test_result} to 71.1%. The accuracy
of *attention_uni* model with power utility rises from 61.1% in
\ref{tab:ericson_test_result} to 70.8%. In the second analysis, I omit
the observations with $x_s\leq$ 5 USD, retaining 66% of the observations
for model fitting. The results for the second analysis are presented in
Panel B of Table \ref{tab:follow_test_result}. The highest accuracy is
for the heuristic model, and its accuracy rate rises from to 74.9%. The
accuracy of *attention_uni* model with power utility rises to 74.8%.

[^6]: The distributions for log magnitude of rewards are similar to
    normal distributions.

In each analysis, there is an increase in the performance of
attention-adjusted models relative to other models. Meanwhile, the
attention-adjusted models with power utility outperform other models
except the heuristic model. I also set the predicted choices from
heuristic models as the labels and apply other fitted models to
predicting it. In the first analysis, *attention* and *attention_uni*
with power utility perform the best in prediction, which have an
accuracy of 93.2% and 92.4%. In the second analysis, the models that
predict the best are *quasihb_fc* and *quasihb* with power utility, with
an accuracy of 94.2% and 93.3%. The *attention_uni* model with power
utility has an accuracy of 91.1%. Therefore, when reward magnitude is
much greater than 0 and only few extreme values are contained in the
data, the attention-adjusted models seem a good substitute to the
heuristic model for researchers who want to save parameters.

## Results for *Ch치vez* data

For *Ch치vez* data, I use MXD as reward unit and days of delay as $t_l$.
Note the rewards range from 11 MXD to 85 MXD, and for either SS or LL,
the distribution of rewards approximates a uniform distribution.
Therefore, Table \ref{tab:chavez_kf_result} shows the goodness of fit
for each model in cross-validation. Similar with Table
\ref{tab:ericson_kf_result}, the *trade* model with power utility
performs the lowest MSE, and the heuristic model performs the best in
MAE, log loss, and accuracy. Though, the goodness of fit of
attention-adjusted models with power utility are close to the *trade*
model in all evaluation metrics. For example, the log loss for
*attention* with power utility (0.486) is only 0.003 higher than that
for *trade* with power utility (0.483). Table
\ref{tab:chavez_test_result} shows the out-of-sample performance of each
model. The heuristic model performs the best in all evaluation metrics,
following *trade*, *attention*, and *attention_uni* with power utility.
The performance between these models are also close. For example, the
accuracy rate of heuristic model is 76.7%, while those of *trade*,
*attention*, and *attention_uni* with power utility are 76.6%, 76.3%,
76.3%. Setting the predicted choices by heuristic model as the labels
and letting the other models to predicting them, we obtain an accuracy
of 96.2% for *trade* with power utililty (the highest), and an accuracy
of 95.9% for attention-adjusted models with power utility (the second
highest).

In summary, I find the heuristic model outperforms than the other models
in predicting human choices on Ericson and *Ch치vez* data. Both
Intertemporal trade-off and attention adjustment (given that *hbmd* is a
special case of attention-adjusted model) can be viewed as good
candidates of mechansim for explaining the choices predicted by the
heuristic model. Remarkably, apart from the heuristic model, the *trade*
model has the largest number of parameters, which has 6. The
*attention_uni* and *attention* model have only 3 and 4 parameters to be
fitted, and the minimum number of parameters among the fitted models is
3. Thus, for people who want to save parameters or draw the predictions
on a normative theory of intertemporal choice, the attention adjustment
mechanism can be a choice.

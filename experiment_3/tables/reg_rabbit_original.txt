The p-values are calculated based on Wald tests. FE denotes individual fixed-effects. Model (1)-(2) are run upon the full sample, (3) is for those having changed choices at least once in intertemporal choice tasks, (4) is for those having made wrong choices in count-the-rabbits tasks. Each model includes an intercept and task-specific dummies. }

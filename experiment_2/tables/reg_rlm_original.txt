    {\par\footnotesize Note: * $p<0.05$, ** $p<0.01$, *** $p<0.005$. Standard errors are reported in the parentheses. Each model is estimated using Huber's M-estimator (where the threshold is set at 1.345) and the scale estimator is Huber's proposal 2 estimator. Each p-value for RLM is calculated based on a normal distribution with i.i.d. assumption. A smaller Muller-Welsh score indicates the model has a greater ability to both parsimoniously fit the data and predict new independent obeservations. $Y_1$ and $T$ denote the front-end amount and the sequence length in Option A. $T_L$ and $T_H$ are 6 months and 12 months respectively. Clustering results are obtained through Gaussian mixture model. FE denotes fixed effects.}

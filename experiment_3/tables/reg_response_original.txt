    {\par\footnotesize Note: * $p<0.05$, ** $p<0.01$, *** $p<0.005$. Both models are estimated through 2SLS method. Standard errors are clustered at the subject level and are reported in the parentheses. The p-values are calculated based on t-tests. Intercept, subject-specific dummies, reward levels (rabbit numbers) and their interactions with the predicted choice are also included in each model, though they are not reported in this table.}

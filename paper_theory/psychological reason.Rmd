I developed a theory that I term "*attentional discounted utility*". The
purpose of this theory is to incorporate an attentional mechanism into
the discounted utility framework. One benefit of doing this is that you
may only need to introduce one additional parameter to a conventional
discounted utility model, in order to account for a broad set of
anomalies. The model also makes some new predictions (such as what I
hope to test in the experiment).

# Attention and Intertemporal Choice

## Reward

In psychological experiments and the real world, it is often found that
people tend to pay more attention to information with higher reward
values, either implicitly or explicitly.

Vision: 1. value-driven attention capture 2. contradicts with the
current goal

For example, in visual search tasks,

search for a salient target can be slowed when a distractor is
associated with a large reward in previous trials [@anderson2011].

@hickey2010 reward changes salience

@failing2018 provides a good review

Finance and risky choices: ostrich effect

General: 1. information has hedonic value 2. utility-weighted sampling
3. relevant - wishful thinking

In finance, investors tend to check their accounts more frequently when
they anticipate gains rather than lossesÂ [@golman_information_2017;
@olafsson_ostrich_2017].

I apply this insight to intertemporal choices.

In intertemporal choice, @noor_intertemporal_2011 advocate using a model
in which the larger reward is less discounted to account for the
magnitude effect.

## Attention as an active sampler

The role of attention in decision making can be understood using the
metaphor of an information-processing system. When the system receives
signals from multiple sources and is unable to process all of this
information at the same time, attention acts as a random sampler,
actively sampling these signals and thus limiting the amount of
information that enters higher-order processing. This view of attention
can be traced back to Broadbent (1958) and is re-emphasized by Gottlieb
(2012). You can see some other decision theories also adopting a similar
view, e.g. decision field theory (Busemeyer and Townsend, 1993).

## Decision process

Suppose time is discrete. Let $X_T$ denote the sequence of rewards
$[x_0,x_1,...,x_T]$, which yields reward $x_t$ in time period $t$.[^1]
The time length of this sequence, denoted by $T$, is finite. For any
$t \in \{0,1,...,T\}$, the reward level $x_t$ is a random variable
defined on $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. I assume that making an intertemporal
choice involves three steps:

[^1]: I use uppercase letters to represent a sequence and lowercase
    letters to represent elements within the sequence.

Step 1. (Sampling) The decision maker subjectively draws a few potential
realizations of $X_T$, and from each drawn realization, she draws a few
time periods and observes their rewards; then, she combines all observed
rewards into a sample.

Step 2. (Valuation) The decision maker uses the mean utility of sampled
rewards as an approximate value representation of $X_T$.

Step 3. (Choice-making) She chooses the sequence with the highest value
from all the available reward sequences.

\setlength{\leftskip}{0pt}

In the decision process described above, Step 3 is standard. By Step
1-2, I take the notion that, to evaluate a stimuli, the decision maker
needs to assess all the relevant information, while her information
processing capacity is limited. Consequently, she selectively attends to
only *a subset* of the available information (which is termed *a
sample*), then aggregates the attributes observed in the sample to
calculate the stimuli value. This sampling process is not unbiased; on
the contrary, the decision maker aims to retain more of the information
that they consider more relevant in the sample. Such a notion has a long
history in psychological research.[^2] In recent years, many theories
grounded in this (or similar notions) have made significant progress in
explaining choice anomalies, such as decision field theory
[@busemeyer_decision_1993], decision-by-sampling
[@stewart_decision_2006], utility-weighted sampling
[@lieder_overrepresentation_2018] and efficient coding theory
[@heng_efficient_2020]. In the next subsection, I describe the sampling
and valuation process in detail.

[^2]: @weber_mindful_2009 and @chun_taxonomy_2011 provide good reviews
    for such studies.
    
Axiom 4 (aggregate invariance to constant sequences) Let
$s^c_{0 \rightarrow T}$ denote a constant sequence where each reward is
equal to $c$. For any sequence $s_{0\rightarrow T}$,
$s'_{0\rightarrow T}$, any non-negative $c$, $c'$, and $\alpha\in(0,1)$,
if
$\alpha \cdot s_t+(1-\alpha)\cdot c\sim\alpha \cdot s'_t+(1-\alpha)\cdot c'$
holds for every $t$, then
$\alpha \cdot s_{0\rightarrow T}+(1-\alpha)\cdot s^c_{0 \rightarrow T}\sim \alpha \cdot s'_{0\rightarrow T}+(1-\alpha)s^{c'}_{0 \rightarrow T}$.


Lemma 3. If Axiom 1-2 and Axiom 4 holds, then for any
$s_{0\rightarrow T}$ and $s'_{0\rightarrow T}$, where
$u(s_t)= u(s'_t)+\Delta u$ holds for any $t$ and $\Delta u$ is a
constant real number, we have $w_t=w'_t$.

Suppose
$\alpha \cdot s_t+(1-\alpha)\cdot c\sim\alpha \cdot s'_t+(1-\alpha)\cdot c'$

From Axiom 1,
$\alpha \cdot u(s_t)+(1-\alpha)\cdot u(c)=\alpha \cdot u(s'_t)+(1-\alpha)\cdot u(c')$

This yields $u(s_t)-u(s'_t)=\Delta u$, where
$\Delta u=\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha} (u(c')-u(c))$.

By Lemma 1, if Axiom 1-2 holds, we have $V(s_c)=u(c)$. The same applies
to $V(s'_c)$.

By Axiom 4, we have
$V(s_{0\rightarrow T})=V(s'_{0\rightarrow T})+\Delta u$.

This yields $\sum_{t=0}^T w_tu(s_t)- w'_tu(s'_t)=\Delta u$

Replace $\Delta u$, we have
$\sum_{t=0}^T w_tu(s_t)- w'_tu(s'_t)=\sum_{t=0}^T w_t(u(s_t)- u(s'_t))$

So, $\sum_{t=0}^T (w_t-w'_t) u(s'_t)=0$

Given each instantaneous utility can be any non-negative real number, we
must have $w_t=w'_t$.

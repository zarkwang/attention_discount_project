## A. Proofs about mutual information

## B. Proofs about common difference effect

Suppose the instantaneous utilities of LL and SS are $v_l$ and $v_s$, and the delays for LL and SS are $t_l$ and $t_s$. Under ADU, the common difference effect implies that, if$$ \tag{B.1}
\frac{1+G(t_s)e^{-v_s}}{v_s} = \frac{1+G(t_l)e^{-v_l}}{v_l}
$$ then for any $\Delta t \geq 0$,$$ \tag{B.2}
\frac{1+G(t_s+\Delta t)e^{-v_s}}{v_s} > \frac{1+G(t_l+\Delta t)e^{-v_l}}{v_l}
$$If $G(T)=T$, we have $G(t+\Delta t) = G(t) + \Delta t$. Thus, after combining with Equation (B.1), Equation (B.2) holds true if and only if$$ \tag{B.3}
\frac{\Delta t e^{-v_s}}{v_s} > \frac{\Delta t e^{-v_l}}{v_l}
$$ Given that function $\psi(v) = e^{-v}/v$ is decreasing in $v$ so long as $v>0$, then Equation (B.3) must be valid.

If $G(T) = \frac{1}{1-\delta}(\delta^{-T}-1)$, we have$$
1+G(t+\Delta t)e^{-v} = \delta^{-\Delta t}[1+G(t)e^{-v}]+(\delta^{-\Delta t}-1)(\frac{e^{-v}}{1-\delta}-1)
$$ Thus, after combining Equation (B.1), Equation (B.2) holds true if and only if$$\tag{B.4}
(\delta^{-\Delta t}-1)\frac{\frac{e^{-v_s}}{1-\delta}-1}{v_s} >
(\delta^{-\Delta t}-1)\frac{\frac{e^{-v_l}}{1-\delta}-1}{v_l}
$$ Given that $0<\delta<1$, we have $\delta^{-\Delta t}>1$, thus Equation (B.4) is valid if and only if$$\tag{B.5}
\frac{1}{v_s}-\frac{1}{v_l}<\frac{1}{1-\delta}(\frac{e^{-v_s}}{v_s}-\frac{e^{-v_l}}{v_l})
$$ From Equation (B.1) we know that$$\tag{B.6}
\frac{1}{v_s}-\frac{1}{v_l}=\frac{1}{1-\delta}\left[\frac{(\delta^{-t_l}-1)e^{-v_l}}{v_l} -\frac{(\delta^{-t_s}-1)e^{-v_s}}{v_s}\right]
$$ Combine Equation (B.5) and (B.6), we have$$
\delta^{-t_l}\frac{e^{-v_l}}{v_l}<\delta^{-t_s}\frac{e^{-v_s}}{v_s} \Longrightarrow v_l - v_s + \ln \left(\frac{v_l}{v_s}\right)>-(t_l-t_s)\ln\delta
$$

## C. Proofs about magnitude effect

Define $V(x,t) = w_t(x) v(x)$, which denotes the overall utility of a reward of level $x$ delivered in period $t$. The reward level of LL and SS are $x_l$ and $x_s$, and the delays for LL and SS are $t_l$ and $t_s$. The magnitude effect implies, for any $x_s$, $x_l$, $t_s$, $t_l$ such that $V(x_s,t_l)=V(x_l,t_l)$, we have $$\tag{C.1}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_s}(\frac{x_l}{x_s})<0 \;\Longrightarrow\; 
\frac{\partial x_l}{\partial V} \frac{\partial V}{\partial x_s}x_s-x_l<0 \;\Longrightarrow\;
\frac{\partial V}{\partial x_s} x_s<\frac{\partial V}{\partial x_l}x_l 
$$

Equation (C.1) is obtained by applying the chain rule of differentiation to decompose the expression on the left-hand side. Before proceeding with further derivation, we first prove that for any $x_s$ and $x_l$, we can always find a pair of $t_s$ and $t_l$ such that the decision maker is indifferent between SS and LL (see Lemma 1). This allows us to focus merely on the relation between $x_s$ and $x_l$.

**Lemma 1**: For any $0<<x_s<x_l<+\infty$, there always exist $t_s$ and $t_l$ such that $V(x_s, t_s) = V(x_l, t_l)$, where $0\leq t_s<t_l<+\infty$.

To prove Lemma 1, we can first fix $t_s$, then show that, for equation $V(x_s, t_s)-V(x_l,t_l)=0$, there exists a solution $t_l$ that is located in $(t_s, +\infty)$. This is obvious given that $V(x,t)$ is a continuous function, and is decreasing in $t$ and increasing in $x$, and converges to 0 when $t$ approaches $+\infty$. When $t_l = t_s$, we must have $V(x_s, t_s)-V(x_l,t_l)<0$; when $t_l \rightarrow +\infty$, we must have $V(x_s, t_s)-V(x_l,t_l)>0$, since it is easy to find a $t_s$ such that $V(x_s, t_s)>>0$. Thus, the function $V(x_s, t_s)-V(x_l,t_l)$ of $t_l$ must have a zero point in $(t_s, +\infty)$. *QED*

Define a function $\xi(x) = x\cdot \partial V/\partial x$. Then Equation (C.1) is valid if and only if $\xi(x_s)<\xi(x_l)$. Note that$$\tag{C.2}
\frac{\partial V}{\partial x} = v'(x)\frac{1+G(t)e^{-v(x)}+v(x)\cdot G(t)e^{-v(x)}}{[1+G(t)e^{-v(x)}]^2}
$$ Meanwhile, assume $V(x_s, t_s) = V(x_l, t_l) \equiv 1+\alpha$, then by the definition of $\alpha$, we have$$\tag{C.3}
G(t)e^{-v(x)}=\frac{v(x)}{1+\alpha}-1
$$ Substitute the $G(t)e^{-v(x)}$ in Equation (C.2) by Equation (C.3), we have $$\tag{C.3}
\frac{\partial V}{\partial x} = (1+\alpha)(v(x)-\alpha)\frac{v'(x)}{v(x)}
$$

Let $e_v(x)$ denote the elasticity of $v(x)$ to $x$, i.e. $e_v(x) = v'(x) \cdot x/v(x)$. Then we can write the expression of $\xi(x)$ as $\xi(x)=(1+\alpha)(v(x)-\alpha)e_v(x)$. The condition of magnitude effect, $\xi(x_s)<\xi(x_l)$, thus implies that $(v(x)-\alpha)e_v(x)$ is increasing in $x$. Now, we can show that this condition is weaker than the condition of magnitude effect in standard DU models (see Lemma 2).

**Lemma 2**: The magnitude effect always holds true when $$\tag{C.4}
\frac{\partial e_v(x)}{\partial x}(v(x)-\alpha)+e_v(x)v'(x)>0
$$

To prove Lemma 2, we can calculate the first-order derivative of $(v(x)-\alpha)e_v(x)$ and set it larger than 0.

As is proposed by @loewenstein_anomalies_1992, in standard DU models, the condition to make magnitude effect appear is $\frac{\partial e_v(x)}{\partial x}>0$. However, in ADU, this can be relaxed by Equation (C.4). First, note that $v(x)$ is the instantaneous utility of reward $x$, and $1+\alpha$ is the discounted utility; thus, we must have $v(x)>1+\alpha$, which implies $v(x)-\alpha>1$. Second, given $v'(x)>0$ and thus $e_v(x)>0$, the inequality in Equation (C.4) can still hold true even when $\frac{\partial e_v(x)}{\partial x}\leq0$.

Finally, by calculating the first-order derivative of $e_v(x)$, we can reformulate Equation (C.4) into$$\tag{C.5}
RRA_v(x)<1+\frac{\alpha}{v(x)-\alpha}e_v(x)
$$ where $RRA_v(x)$ is the relative risk aversion coefficient of $v(x)$, i.e. $RRA_v(x)=-xv''(x)/v'(x)$. Note that $\alpha$ is mediated by the time of delay ($t_s$ and $t_l$). When both $t_s$ and $t_l$ approaches $+\infty$, $\alpha$ will converge to -1. Thus, in Equation (C.5) , the $\frac{\alpha}{v(x)-\alpha}$ will converge from above to $-\frac{1}{v(x)+1}$, given $x$ is fixed. To keep Equation (C.5) valid for any feasible $\alpha$, we need that $$
RRA_v(x)\leq 1-\frac{e_v(x)}{v(x)+1}
$$

## D. Proofs about convexity of time discounting

If $w_t(x)$ is convex in $t$, we should have $\frac{\partial^2 w_t(x)}{\partial t^2}\geq 0$. By the definition of $w_t(x)$, this is equivalent to $$\tag{D.1}
2G'(t)^2\geq(G(t)+e^{v(x)})G''(t)
$$ If $G(t)=t$, i.e. each period is initially equal-weighted, then $G'(t)=1$, $G''(t)=0$. Thus, Equation (D.1) must be valid.

If $G(t)=(1-\delta)^{-1}(\delta^{-t}-1)$, i.e. the initial weights decline in an exponential fashion, where $0<\delta<1$, then $G'(t)=(1-\delta)^{-1}(-\ln\delta)\delta^{-t}$, $G''(t)=(-\ln\delta)G'(t)$. Thus, Equation (D.1) is valid when $$\tag{D.2}
\delta^{-t}\geq(1-\delta)e^{v(x)}-1
$$

Given $t\geq 0$, Equation (D.2) holds true in two cases. The first case is $1\geq (1-\delta)e^{v(x)}-1$, which implies that $v(x)$ is below or equal to a certain threshold $v(\underline{x})$, where $v(\underline{x})=\ln(\frac{2}{1-\delta})$. The second case is that $v(x)$ is above $v(\underline{x})$ and $t$ is above a threshold $\underline{t}$. In that case, we can take the logarithm of both sides of the inequality. It turns out that $\underline{t}=\frac{\ln[(1-\delta)e^{v(x)}-1]}{-\ln\delta}$.

## E. Proofs about violation of diminishing sensitivity

The second-order condition for $V(x,t)$ being concave in $x$ is $\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x^2}<0$. Let $g=G(t)$. Given that $t\geq1$, we have $g\geq1$. By calculating the second-order derivative of $V$ in $x$, we can obtain

$$\tag{E.1}
\frac{v\frac{g-\exp(v)}{g+\exp(v)}+2}{v\frac{g+\exp(v)}{g}+1}<\frac{-v''}{(v')^2}
$$

For simplicity, we omit the parentheses and variable of the utility function. So, in Equation (E.1), $v$ denotes $v(x)$. We represent the RHS of Equation (E.1) by $f(x;g)$.

**Lemma 3**: There exists a threshold $\bar{x}$ in $(0,+\infty)$, such that $f(x;g)\leq0$ if and only if $x\geq\bar{x}$.

To prove Lemma 3, we can rearrange the numerator of $f(x;g)$. It can be derived that $f(x;g)\leq 0$ implies $\frac{v-2}{v+2}e^{v}\geq g$. First, set $h(v)=\frac{v-2}{v+2}e^{v}$ and calculate the first-order derivative of $h(v)$. Clearly, when $v\leq2$, we must have $h(v)<g$. When $v>2$, we will have $h'(v)>0$; so, $h(v)$ is an increasing function in $(2,+\infty)$. Second, let $v=g+2$ and show that $h(g+2)> g$. Note that $g\geq1$ and the inequality $h(g+2)>g$ can be rearranged to $e^{g+2}-g>4$. Due to the fact that the function $e^{g+2}-g$ of $g$ is increasing when $g\geq 1$, and $e^3-1\approx19>4$, the inequality must hold true. Finally, given that $h(2)<g$, $h(g+2)>g$, and $h(v)$ is increasing in $[2,g+2]$, there must be an unique solution of equation $h(v)=g$ in $(2, g+2)$. Suppose this unique solution is $v(\bar{x})$, then we can conclude that $f(x;g)\leq0$ when $x\in[\bar{x},+\infty)$ and $f(x;g)>0$ when $x\in[0,\bar{x})$.

From Lemma 3, we know that when $x$ is large enough, i.e. $x\in [\bar{x},+\infty)$, Equation (E.1) always holds true. Then we will focus on the interval $[0, \bar{x})$.

Given that $-\frac{v''}{(v')^2}=\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{1}{v'})$, we can construct the following ordinary differential equations:$$\tag{E.2}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{1}{v'})&=f(x;g) \\
 \frac{dv}{dx}&=v'
\end{aligned}
$$

By applying the Picard's theorem of existence and uniqueness on Equation (E.2), we can obtain Lemma 4.

**Lemma 4**: Equation (E.2) has a unique solution in $[0,\bar{x})$ if

(1) $f(x;g)$ and $v'$ are continuous in $x$ when $x\in[0,\bar{x})$, and they are bounded, i.e. there exists a finite number $M$ such that $f(x;g)+v'\leq M$;

(2) $f(x;g)$ and $v'$ satisfy Lipschitz condition, i.e. for any $x_1$, $x_2$ in $[0,\bar{x})$, there exist finite numbers $L_1$ and $L_2$ such that

$$
\begin{aligned}
|f(x_1;g)-f(x_2;g)|\leq L_1(|v(x_1)-v(x_2)|+|\frac{1}{v'(x_1)}-\frac{1}{v'(x_2)}|)\\
|v'(x_1)-v'(x_2)|\leq L_2(|v(x_1)-v(x_2)|+|\frac{1}{v'(x_1)}-\frac{1}{v'(x_2)}|)
\end{aligned}
$$

**Lemma 5**: $f(x;g)$ is decreasing in $x$ when $x\in[0,\bar{x})$.

To prove Lemma 5 we first define $\zeta(v)=1+g^{-1}e^{v}$, which is an increasing function of $v$. Then, the function $f(x;g)$ can be written as

$$\tag{E.3}
f(x;g)=\frac{v\cdot(\frac{2}{\zeta(v)}-1)+2}{v\cdot\zeta(v)+1}
$$

Note that $v$ is increasing in $x$. It is clear that $\frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial x}>0$, and $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\frac{2}{\zeta}-1)<0$. Second, we calculate the first-order derivative of $f(x; g)$ and let $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}<0$, which implies that

$$\tag{E.4}
v'\left[\left((\frac{2}{\zeta}-1)-v\cdot\frac{2\zeta'}{\zeta^2}\right)(v\zeta+1)-(\zeta+v\zeta')\left(v(\frac{2}{\zeta}-1)+2\right)\right]<0
$$

where $\zeta$ denotes $\zeta(v)$, $\zeta'$ denotes the first-order derivative of $\zeta$ in $v$. Equation (E.4) can be transformed to

$$\tag{E.5}
2\frac{\zeta'}{\zeta}v(v+1)+\zeta'v(v+2)+2\zeta-(\frac{2}{\zeta}-1)>0
$$

Note that $\zeta'=g^{-1}e^{v}=\zeta-1$, which is increasing in $x$. Meanwhile, $\frac{\zeta'}{\zeta}=1-\frac{1}{\zeta}$ is also increasing in $x$. Thus, the RHS of Equation (E.5) is increasing in $x$. We only need to show that the RHS is positive even when $x$ approaches its minimum value. Finally, let $x=0$, which is its minimum, then the RHS becomes $2(1+g)+1-2/(1+g)$. This must be positive, given that $g>1$. *QED*

## F. Proofs about attention-grabbing effect

## Others

## 

Meanwhile, by definition, $D_{KL}$ is increasing in $w(s_t|s)$ and is convex. To solve the model, one can simply set a Lagrange multiplier $\gamma$, then construct the FOC condition that, for any $s \in X$ and $t \in \{0,1,…,T\}$, $\frac{\partial D_{KL}}{\partial w(s_t|s)} = u(s_t) + \gamma$. Given that $u'>0$ and the convexity of $D_{KL}$ ensures its first derivative increasing in $w(s_t|s)$, the solution of $w(s_t|s)$ should be increasing with $s_t$. This enables the decision maker to perform greater patience for a larger reward.

While building the model, I was mainly inspired by the theories of rational inattention [@matejka_rational_2015; @jung_discrete_2019; @mackowiak_rational_2023]. In @matejka_rational_2015's theory of rational inattention, the decision maker makes choices between discrete alternatives; she evaluates each alternative via a costly information acquisition process, then decides the optimal choice strategy. The theory deduces the probability of each alternative being chosen should follow a logistic-like distribution. In ADU, I assume the discounting factors are generated by a similar process; hence, she subjectively weights each time period according to a logistic-like distribution as well.

The reason why I use Shannon mutual information as the cognitive cost function is twofold. First, note that $w(s_t|s) \propto w^0_t e^{u(s_t)/\lambda}$. Given a certain stream $s$ and two time periods $t_1$ and $t_2$ ($t_2>t_1$), the relative weight between them $\frac{w(s_{t_1}|s)}{w(s_{t_2}|s)}$ is only relevant to $s_{t_1}$ and $s_{t_2}$. Therefore, changing the reward of a third period has no impact on how the reward in $t_2$ should be discounted relative to that in $t_1$. Second, under such settings, the objective function can be rewritten as$$
\sum_{s\in X} p(s)[w(s_t|s)u(s_t) - \lambda D_{KL}]
$$

where $D_{KL}$ is the KL divergence between the initial weights over time periods and the weights updated given the stream $s$ is drawn. Clearly, the determination of $w(s_t|s)$ in each $s$ can be separated from each other. In other words, given two potentially realized streams $s$ and $s'$, the changes in $s'$ has no impact on the determination of discounting factors in $s$. This property is consistent with many forms of optimal sequential learning [@caplin_rationally_2022]. @matejka_rational_2015 show that the two properties are jointly satisfied if and only if the solution of $w(s_t|s)$ follows Equation (1).

Suppose $p(s)$ also equals to the true probability that $s$ is realized. After decides the $w(s_t|s)$, the decision maker can obtain the discounted utility (DU) of each potentially realized stream $s$. I assume she wants to find a risky reward stream, denoted by $p$, that maximizes her expected discounted utility. Therefore,$$
p = \arg\max_{p\in P} \left\{\sum_{s\in X} \sum_{t=0}^T p(s)w(s_t|s)u(s_t)\right\}
$$

Given that the discounting factor $w(s_t|s)$ is formed by an attention-adjusted evaluation procedure. I term the model alike as attention-adjusted DU (ADU). ADU suggests that the so-called discounting factors are the attention weights that decision makers assign to each time period.

The limited attention and costly attention adjustment can be characterized by intertemporal correlation aversion and magnitude-increasing patience. The rationale for using Shannon mutual information as the cognitive cost function is that, under a certain state, the discounting factor in a certain period should be independent from irrelevant periods and irrelevant states.

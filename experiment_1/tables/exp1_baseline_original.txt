    {\par\footnotesize Note: * $p<0.05$, ** $p<0.01$, *** $p<0.005$. Standard errors are clustered at the subject level and are reported in the parentheses. The p-values are calculated based on Wald tests. $X_c$ denotes the amount constant in a choice list, and its middle and highest levels are $X_{mid}$ and $X_{high}$. $T$ denotes the delay of the back-end amount, and its middle and highest levels are $T_{mid}$ and $T_{high}$. $M$ denotes amount in the single option, and its higher level is $M_{high}$. $X_v$ denotes the amount varying across rows. The utility function is $u(x)=x^{0.695}$. Column (2) and (4) reports the results of a fixed-effect (FE) model, which includes participant-specific dummies as random intercepts.}
